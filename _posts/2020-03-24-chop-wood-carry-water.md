I don’t have a lot of wise words to give in these troubled times.

I’m just a designer, and I don’t know anything more than the news that I read each week.
I’m not a doctor, a psychiatrist, or a scientist.
I’m a dad, husband, and freelancer, who tries to keep all these parts of his life afloat in rough times.

And it’s hard work, as you surely know.

One thing that I repeat to myself for the last two weeks is this mantra: chop wood, carry water.
It comes from a Buddhist text:

> Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.
After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

I don’t have extended knowledge of Buddhism and I didn’t study it properly.
So my interpretation of this sentence may be wrong.

However, I find a lot of solace and strength in it.

The idea that no event is strong enough to change your daily routine is somehow soothing.
To know that after success, I’ll still have to wake up, take care of the kiddo and do the work is humbling.
To know that in times of trouble, this routine will stay the same is structuring.

In these strange times, when so many habits have changed in our lives, this mantra helps me stay cold headed.
It also helps me to stay focus on what matters most despite the loud noises and perils of the outside world.
