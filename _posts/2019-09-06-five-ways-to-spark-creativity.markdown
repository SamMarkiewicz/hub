_According to someone who frequently struggles with it._

Ok, we‚Äôve all been there.

And if it is not yet the case, then, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll soon have to face it.
Finding yourself in front of a blank page that you look like a jerk without knowing what to do is a common thing.

The good news is that ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù is not a gift from heaven, and can be trigger by a few exercises.
On this point, I am a disciple of Brian Eno‚Äôs pragmatism.

The next five points are exercises that I practice when this kind of inconvenience happens to me (and they happen at least once or twice a week :)).

I hope that they can also work for you.

## ‚è≥ Use a timer

If you  [follow me on Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/sammarkiewicz/) (I‚Äôm not saying that you should do it, but, you should consider it seriously ! _I‚Äôm kidding_), I often post the result of my warm-up sessions.

Sometimes they have a very different style from what I produce. Sometimes I do very simple things, or complicated, and sometimes, I do shit.

Of all I‚Äôm going to talk about here, this exercise is the one I use the most.
What do I do?
I program an hour timer, I run Procreate, and I scribble something.  
With just a single rule: even if I find myself in the flow, I stop after an hour (approximately).  
I try to do my best to finish it, or I live with the idea that the piece will stay the way it is.
I‚Äôve found that the frustration of not finalizing or polishing is also a good engine (_reminder: this would be an idea for a future post_).

The primary goal of this exercise is to wiggle my hand and to ‚Äúcalibrate‚Äù my eye.  
In short, to put me in the mood.

**I love doing illustrations. But unfortunately, I don‚Äôt wake every morning with extra freshness and motivation.**  
**So, this exercise is a way to get into the water without any pressure.**  
In the worst case, I will have lost an hour.

Spoilers!  
Even if the first minutes could be hard and my brain wants to do anything but this, I often find myself absorbed.  
In any case, **I‚Äôm reminding myself that I‚Äôm not here to release a masterpiece but to ‚Ä¶ do something**.  
That is a pillar of creativity, and one the best advice I‚Äôve ever had: do something.

**Note:**  
There are more extreme variants.  
For example, you can set an hour, and make rounds of 10 or 5 minutes. It can be exhausting, but it‚Äôs pretty effective too.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Remix yourself

You and I are human beings. Which means: we evolve.

There is something good in these last two words.  
They promise that the person we were 5 years ago was different from today and the one from the next 5 years.

**And if you practice a sport or artistic discipline, it means that what you produce should have followed the same path.**  
When I find myself out of inspiration, I sometimes check my old sketchbooks and take a fresh look at what I‚Äôve done.  
Sometimes I come across laughable stuff.  
Sometimes I re-evaluate things that I may have overlooked.

**A nice exercise is to take one of these old work that you‚Äôve done and remix it again using your current style** (old: think one or two years ago rather than two weeks. We all progress, but not that fast :)),.  
Like a kind of personal #drawthisinyourstyle.  
It‚Äôs a nice thing to do, and it has the merit of putting you in the saddle.  
Plus you may find some patterns or gimmicks to re-inject into your current work (I save that for another story).

## üéí Try something new

Likely, you have already heard of this method.  
It has been used by  [Brian Eno,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies)Tom Waits, Thom Yorke, TV on the radio, etc ‚Ä¶ and consists (for them) to change instruments when they are unable to produce anything.

This means that if you‚Äôre a dry guitarist, you pick up a harmonica, drums or bagpipe, and see what you can get out of it.  
The result could be shit‚Ä¶ or gold.  
You can adapt this technique for illustration.

Let‚Äôs say that you spend most of your time using vector and that you feel stuck.  
Go get charcoals, colored pencils or even Play-Doh, and see what you can do with that.

**Get out of your comfort zone.**  
Once again, the goal is not to release a masterpiece (if it happens, good for you !).  
The goal is to unleash your brain, to give it fresh air.

üí° You can even do a combo during your next outage by remixing your last drawing done in watercolor!

## ‚õì Put on handcuffs

Well, I‚Äôm not going to talk about handcuffs in the 50 shades of gray style.  
A little more in the sense of a magician locked in a vat of water, or, MacGyver.  
**Yes, that‚Äôs it, think MacGyver !**

Of course, I will not ask you to wonder what you can do with sunglasses, a spray can and a piece of swiss cheese (üí° : not much).

Rather, what you can do with :

1. two colors
2. three geometric shapes
3. only solid areas and no outlines
4. etc

You get the idea.
**The goal is to use your creativity to get you out of these constraints.**

Do not panic, stay calm, embrace the constraints, and you should be able to get something out.

## üëãüñï Say goodbye to perfection

Do you remember the best advice given to me: do something?  
It went hand in hand with another, more implicit advice: **put perfection aside.**

One of the things that can block creativity is the concern for perfection, the fear of doing something that is not hyper polished, the fear of missing the best shot‚Ä¶

Perfection can be scary, and creativity does not like fear.  
I‚Äôm going to push an open door, but: perfection does not exist.

**High-quality work exists, but the concept of an immaculate result, is pure bullshit.**

The lack of perfection should reassure you.

It is thanks to that that you can tell you that you will do better next time.  
And so that you will progress.  
Again and again.
Some will tell me: Mozart‚Äôs music was perfect!  
To which I would answer: if it was true, classical music would have stopped with him since there would be nothing more to do or say.

**Embrace error, chance, happy accidents, and know when to stop.**

**Ship it !**

## üòá Extra wisdom: drop the ball (for a moment)

Sometimes, despite all these bits of advice, exercises, tricks and incantations that I can try‚Ä¶ nothing comes.  
In those moments, I stop being stubborn, and I leave my office. I go out of my house. I go for a walk or run. I go to the nearest theater.

**In short, I put all that aside, and breathe.**

And that‚Äôs sometimes all the brain needs.  
Tranquility or entertainment, a break that distracts from the problem.  
In general, after these few minutes or hours, things return to normal.  
**In any case, even if creativity is not a magic thing and it can be summoned, we only stay human beings. Demotivation, fatigue, emotions or physical manifestations can prevent us from producing anything.**

Knowing when and how to drop the ball is also a sign of humility.

So, these were my five pieces of advice.  
Of course, this is my personal experience, and you can find these standards or ineffective.  
Although I hope you find some of them useful, and that you can test them (which is the case, I‚Äôm really interested in feedback).  
Still, the Internet is vast, and you can easily find lots of other tips or exercises to help you.  
I‚Äôve put a little list at the end of books that helped or inspired me.  
If you have some resources too, do not hesitate to share!
