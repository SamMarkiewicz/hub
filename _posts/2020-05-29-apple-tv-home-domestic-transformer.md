I started to watch [Apple TV's Home](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/home/umc.cmc.5xjrgoblr5l5i1ypamtayuhe9){:target="_blank"} a few days ago, and aside from the beautiful pictures, it's quite entertaining to watch if you like pragmatic architecture and art.

One of the episodes which caught me the most was the Hong Kong one, presenting the apartment of [designer and architect Gary Chang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Chang_(architect)){:target="_blank"}. His studio is called Domestic Transformer, and it's fantastic to watch it!

To be short, this is a lesson in how you can make the most out of a 32m square place.

It's pragmatic, beautiful (a bit cold though), and inspiring if you look after solutions to the rise of tiny spaces in big cities.

Another thing that I've found interesting is the subject of the relationship with your home. Indeed, we often adapt to a predefined structure, which is not always great for our usage.

Our needs of space, sorting, light, etc. are evolving with our moods, needs, and new family members, and houses are fixed structure not easily evolutive.

The solution proposed by Gary Chang in that sense is a must-watch.
