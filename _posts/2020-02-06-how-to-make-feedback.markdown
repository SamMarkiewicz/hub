description: Thoughts about how to ask for feedback, and how to give them too.

If you work in the design field, you know that one of our dread is feedback.

Articulating a criticism is hard, and receiving it, even harder.  
Everything can be criticized, and everyone has an opinion.   
Most of the time feedback brings pain and torment, and it could result in sterile discussions.

I’ve been through this, and here are some small basic tips I’ve learned along the way that could help you.

## 1. If you ask for feedback
**Stay focus and be specific.**

*“What do you think of my layout/Illustration/etc ?”* is the best way to open the gates of hell.
Everyone has an opinion, and they want to share it.
Asking that kind of question can expose you to various subjective answers, ranging from positive to discouraging.

If you want feedback, ask for something specific, and identify which part of your work on whom you have doubts.
What do you think of that area? Is it visible/readable/clear ?
Ask targeted questions, and avoid hell.

**Provide context**

"That color is awful, that font is disgusting, that logo is a nightmare."
Sounds familiar?
Yes, but maybe you didn’t have the choice.

Skip that part, and set the frame for what is important.

If you ask for feedback to someone out of the project: try to provide a context.
Who is your client, what are the stakes, what is the issue you’re trying to solve there?

Try to give hints about external constraints.

Don’t let critics run like wild horses. Put fences.

**Don’t bring all the village to the party**

Repeat after me: everyone has an opinion and everyone loves to share it.
Multiply that by five, and it might result in 5 people starting a conversation that could drift in unpleasant territories.

Until it’s required, don’t let a crowd gather around your desk and disperse it.
After all, this is not a contest, they will not win something in the end.

You can tell them that you'll gladly consider their feedback, but... later.

**Decline unsolicited feedback**

Everyone has an… Should I repeat myself? No, of course :)

Sometimes, people will come to your desk, attracted or puzzled by what they see on your screen.
Sometimes they will want to share their opinion and advice to you.

You can welcome them, or tell them that for now, you don’t need any feedback.

If you choose the first option, remember the two first tips and provide the frame. If things go south, listen, be polite and then, close the conversation.

## 2. If you give feedback
**Resist**

You have eyes, you have an opinion, fine.
Now, until what you’d seen is provocative, awful or disrespectful to the human eyes: resist and stay away.

The one who’s working is probably focused on his work.
Maybe that work is in its early stages.
Maybe its more difficult than it looks, etc…
So, don’t interrupt.

If you want to share your opinion: ask them.
Politely.
Send an email to ask if it’s possible to chat about what you’ve seen later, and if you receive a positive answer, then go.

**Stay focus, and be specific**

Yes, the same advice is also good for the one who provides feedback.
If someone asks you a specific question, try to answer the question or help to fix the issue.
If someone asks you a broad question: avoid the quick, broad, subjective answer.
Try to determine which part should be discussed.

You hate orange, that’s a matter of taste, but that is probably not relevant in the project.

There should be a bigger issue to address :)

**Ask for context**

There again, that advice is the same for both the one who gives and the one who receives the feedback.
When a colleague asks for feedback (and I don’t know anything about the project), I always ask about the context. Before having a look a the layout.

Tell me the story. Tell me what’s the goal. I’m curious.

It will help me to keep for myself irrelevant questions, and ask some others, hopefully, more pertinent.

**The person is not the work**

At all means, don’t formulate a critic that targets a person. A person is not his work, so, please, always be kind and separate what you see from the one who did it.

Maybe you’ll find those tips too easy, but, I can assure you that most of the time, they are difficult to apply.
Because of the nature of the work, of the place we’re working, the people we’re working with, or simply our nature.
But if you try some of them, even on a small scale, I hope that they will help you to improve your daily tasks and the way you interact with your teammates.
